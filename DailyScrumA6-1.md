### Name of team member: Brandon
**Branch worked on:**
security_sql_xss,
deployment_place_order

What is the progress so far? 
Fixed running docker problem and acquired all necessary security files
1. Cannot install docker for Windows 10 home (only for pro, enterprise, or education)... desktop issues
		i) A way to do it is enable WSL (windows subsystem for linux) 2 integration
			-> Runs linux bianry executables natively
			-> Must install Ubuntu first, then enable virtualization as a Windows feature
			-> Desktop probs has malware, so laptop was used to run docker since it has virtualization enabled
		ii) Based on the last sprint (and can be replicated for this one), using the docker pull command for the iamge
			should allow it to then run on my machine (testing on another machine)
2. Installed sqlmap and replicated Talia's trials for SQL injection from last sprint to understand how to 
		do it for this sprint (compared personal results to previous sprint results and noted any discrepancies)
3. Installed pwnxss and replicated Zac's trials for XSS from alst sprint to understand how to
		do it for this sprint (compared personal results to previous sprint results and noted any discrepancies)


Any difficulties?
- Number of injection trials are not identical to Talia's results (inconsistency)

What is the plan for the days before the deadline?
- create PR and merge after approval

- help other team members when needed!
