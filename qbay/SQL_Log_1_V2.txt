[23:43:49] [INFO] testing 'Generic UNION query (NULL) - 1 to 10 columns'
[23:43:50] [WARNING] POST parameter 'balance' does not seem to be injectable
[23:43:50] [ERROR] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent', skipping to the next target
[23:43:50] [INFO] you can find results of scanning in multiple targets mode inside the CSV file 'C:\Users\Brandon\AppData\Local\sqlmap\output\results-12082021_1143pm.csv'
